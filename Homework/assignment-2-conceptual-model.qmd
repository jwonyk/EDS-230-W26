### 1. State your modeling goal clearly and precisely and the type of goal (understanding, prediction or communication)

Our modeling goal is to understand what environmental and biological factors influence the speed of monarch butterfly migration.

### 2. List the key inputs, parameters and outputs (as precisely as possible, think about space and time)

a)  Inputs: Time, Wind Speed, Temperature, Plant Availability (food), which vary across the migration.

-   Time: Month of the year
-   Wind speed: km/h
-   Air temperature: Degrees C
-   Plant Availability: Density of milkweed, plants per square meter

b)  Parameters: factors that are kept constant that influence the speed of monarch migration

- Butterfly flight speed: km/h
- Carrying capacity: number of butterflies/square kilometer
- Optimal temperature range for migration: Degrees C

c)  Outputs: Butterfly population count in different spatial zones (each square kilometer within the study area)


















### 3. Sketch the underlying conceptual model that would relate inputs/parameters to the outputs
